# Into-The-Void - Mobile - Android / iOS

Into the Void is an personal project that utilizes an number of free assets which can be found in the credits of the project.
This is still an work in progress and all code is subject to refactoring. There is little to no code comments due to the commitment
i have undertook to ensure that i understand the code i am writing when relooking.

The project aims to become an roguelike pokemon battle based game. With 50+ creatures and 70+ abilities at this current date of writing (06/02/2020)
The main progression of the game is by making choices, either Battling, Shopping, Opening Rewards, or events. After each 9 options, the 10th
is an boss fight aimed at simulating the feeling of fighting an Gym or Elite 4 leader.

There will be Artefacts and Items that allow for an more dynamic run each time, and the way that the player chooses which abilities are on
each void walker will influence the way the game plays.

At this current moment in time there is no current release date and everything is subject to change.
